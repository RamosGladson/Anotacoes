# Cloud concepts

## Benefits and Considerations

### High Availability
> Mantain aceptable continuous performance despite temporary load

* Data center redundancies
  - Power
  - Cooling
  - Networking
  - Etc
* Availability zone redundancies
  - One or more datacenters
* Region redundancies
  - Multiple availability

### Fault tolerance
> Ability to continue operating properly

* Proative
  - Regularly back up
  - Deploy to multiple availability zones or regions
  - Load balance across multiple availability zones or regions
  - Monitor health or data/apps/resources

* Reactive
  - Restore data/apps/resources to diferent availability zones or regions
  - Deploy to diferent availability zones or regions

### Disaster recovery
> Ability to back up and restore data/apps/resources

* Can use cloud to restore
  - On-premises to on-premises
  - On-premises to cloud
  - Cloud to on-premises
  - Cloud to Cloud

### Scalability
> Ability to increase te instance count or size of existing resources

* Scaling out
  - Increase instance count or existing resources
  - Non-disruptive

* Scaling up
  - Increase instance size of existing resources
  - Disruptive

## Elasticity
> Ability to increase te instance count or size of existing resources, based on flutuations in traffic or load, or in resource workload

- Both directions (in/out, up/down)
- Manual or automatic
- Based on changes in load or workload
- Pay only for what you use

### Business Agility
> An organization's ability to rapidly adapt to market and environmental changes in productive and cost-effective ways and take advantage of available resources to meet customer demands

* Focus on time to value
  - Get new products to market as soon as possible
  - Shorter feedback cycles
  - Faster return on investment

* Inovations
  - Always look for better way of doing things

* Low latency
  - The sooner decision can be acted upon, the sooner the busness knows whether the decision was right and what else needs to be done

* Economic effectiveness
  - Cost-effective processes and use of resources

* Rapid adaptation
  - Continually monitoring and adapting to changing market conditions

* Flexibility
  - Move quickly to take advantage of new opportunities
